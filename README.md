# Preact codemirror

This is a simple wrapper around the [codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) editor for use with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for deno.

Completely stolen from [react-codemirror](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-codemirror) and adapted to Preact. (Check out the original project for the react version)
